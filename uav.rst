Parachute system
----------------------

Components of the parachute system:

.. figure:: _static/_images/parashute/para1.png

   :width: 300

   1 – parachute compartment cover;
   2 – parachute dome;
   3 – pockets for laying rigging lines;
   4 – rigging lines;
   5 – locking ring;
   6 – long static line;
   7 – short static line with unhook ring system.


.. attention:: Make sure that the parachute dome, rigging lines and their attachment to the dome are not damaged before laying the parachute. The dome and rigging lines should be dry and clean. Repack the parachute if the previous packaging is more than 10 days ago, or you were carrying the complex in an airplane.

****Packing of the parachute****

1) Check the parachute is not damaged.
2) Make sure the rigging lines are not tangled.
3) Make sure, that rigging lines are not tangled in the process of laying the parachute.
4) Control the position of the rigging lines pockets. They must remain on the outside of the folded dome.
5) Smooth the dome and fold it in half, aligning one side with other.

6) Fold the dome in half and align the edges.

   Folding the dome in half second time

7) As the result, the rigging lines should be collected in 4 bundles with 4 rigging lines in each.

8) Fold the dome in half again. The pockets for laying the rigging lines must be outside.

9) Fold the dome as see a picture.

   Folding the dome

Make sure that in the process of laying the parachute rigging lines are not tangled. Straighten the lines out if it needs.

10) Put rigging lines in the pocket. Measure the length of the bundle of rigging lines exceeding the depth of the pocket. Fold the rigging lines bundle in half and stretch in the pocket, so that the bend of the bundle a few centimeters protruded from the opposite side of the pocket. If necessary, you can eliminate the slack of the rigging lines at the edge of the dome by pulling them over the bend on the opposite side of the bundle.

   Result

The rigging lines remaining part is positioned between the loops of the rigging lines after laying.

12) Fold the dome as see a picture.

Installing the parachute in the UAV
-------------------------------------

1) Turn the UAV. The parachute compartment was on top.
2) Pick up a carabiner and straight the rigging lines.
3) Put the short static line end in a carabiner (see a picture).
